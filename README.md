# Welcome to my **personal development notes** repository.

This is a living knowledge base of everything I learn, think through, and build while working on software projects. It includes:

- Architecture decisions
- API designs
- Frontend/back-end notes
- Lessons learned
- Code snippets
- Resources
- Planning docs for _all_ my projects
- ...and will probably add more

## ✅ Why This Exists

1. **To document my learning as a developer.**
2. **To track project decisions.**
3. **To build my own technical reference.**
4. **For future me, so I don’t have to Google the same things twice.**

## ✍️ How I Use This Repo

- **Projects** → One folder per major project with its own notes.
- **Topics** → General concepts, code snippets, research.
- **Quick notes first → refine later** → No need for perfect organization upfront.
- Use Markdown headings, checklists, and bullet points liberally.

## 📌 Future Plans

- Gradually organize better as the repo grows.
- Keep it messy → make it useful.
